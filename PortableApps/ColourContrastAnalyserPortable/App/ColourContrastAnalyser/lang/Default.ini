lcr_note=1.4.2 Contrast (Minimum):  Text (and images of text) have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except if the text is pure decoration.  Larger scale text (at least 18 point or 14 point bold) or images of text can have a contrast ratio of 3:1. (Level AA)
lcr_note2=1.4.4 Contrast (Enhanced): Text (and images of text) have a contrast ratio of at least 7:1, except if the text is pure decoration.  Larger scale text (at least 18 point or 14 point bold) or images of text can have a contrast ratio of 5:1. (Level AAA) How to meet 1.4.4

HP_Note=Note: Whilst the colour difference doesn't comply with the W3C specified range, it does comply with the range used by Hewlett Packard. Hewlett Packard recommends a colour difference limit of 400.
brightness_pass=The difference in brightness between the two colours is sufficient. The threshold is 125, and the result of the foreground and background colours is %d.
brightness_fail=The difference in brightness between the two colours is not sufficient. The threshold is 125, and the result of the foreground and background colours is %d.
colours_pass=The difference in colour between the two colours is sufficient. The threshold is 500, and the result of the foreground and background colours is %d
colours_fail=The difference in colour between the two colours is not sufficient. The threshold is 500, and the result of the foreground and background colours is %d.
