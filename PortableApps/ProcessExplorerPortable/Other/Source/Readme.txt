LICENSE
=======
This package and its launcher are released under the GPL. The launcher is the 
PortableApps.com Launcher, available with full source and documentation from

The base application's source code (if applicable) is available from the 
portable app's homepage.

ABOUT PROCESS EXPLORER PORTABLE
===============================
The Process Explorer Portable Launcher allows you to run Process Explorer from a 
removable drive whose letter changes as you move it to another computer. The 
application can be entirely self-contained on the drive and then used on any 
Windows computer.

INSTALLATION / DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
==================================
By default, the program expects the following directory structure:

-\ <--- Directory with ProcessExplorerPortable.exe
	+\App\
		+\ProcessExplorer\
	+\Data\
		+\settings\

PROCESSEXPLORERPORTABLE.INI CONFIGURATION
=========================================
The Process Explorer Portable Launcher will look for an INI file called 
ProcessExplorerPortable.ini in the same directory as ProcessExplorerPortable.exe 
(copy from Other\Source). The INI file is formatted as follows:

AdditionalParameters=
DisableSplashScreen=false
RunLocally=false

The AdditionalParameters entry allows you to pass additional commandline 
parameter entries to procexp.exe. Whatever you enter here will be appended to 
the call to procexp.exe.

The DisableSplashScreen entry allows you to run the Process Explorer Portable 
Launcher without the splash screen showing up. The default is false.

The RunLocally entry allows you to set Process Explorer Portable to run from the 
local machine's temp directory. This can be useful for instances where you'd 
like to run Process Explorer Portable from a CD or when you're working on a 
machine that may have spyware or viruses and you'd like to keep your device set 
to read-only mode. The only caveat is, of course, that any changes you make that 
session aren't saved back to your device. When done running, the local temp 
directories used by Process Explorer Portable are removed.
