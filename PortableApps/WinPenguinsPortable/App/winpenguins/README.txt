Ricky NOTES

I've revived this old project for a bit of fun. Penguins wander around your desktop 
and engage in activities such as as reading, falling and skateboarding. 
I've added quite a few things and fixed some bugs. Read the changelog for more details.
You can use the left and right arrow keys to change the direction of the skateboarders. 
Position the cursor or a window over a penguin to explode it or pop the balloons so they tumble. 
Right-click the penguin icon in the system tray to access options or exit the app.
Enjoy :)
