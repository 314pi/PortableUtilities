Copy winpenguins.exe and winmon.dll somewhere and run them.  However 

winmon.dll is no longer required, if it cannot be found winpenguins.exe

will extract a copy of winmon.dll from it's resources and use that instead.

Ricky Update: winmon.dll isn't required as it's now a resource embedded into the exe.
Also I've made it so the MFC libraries are statically linked so there shouldn't be a problem with missing DLL files :) (I hope)


Winpenguins has only been tested on Windows 2000 and Windows 98.  

However it should work for Windows 95 or Windows NT.
  

I've received feedback that Winpenguins does work with Windows 95, 

but you may need mfc42.dll.  This DLL is available for download 

on the Winpenguins homepage.

Ricky Update: Works on Windows 7 x64. Should also work on Windows 7 x86, XP and Vista x86/64.
