* Fixed issues caused by minimized windows with sub windows, fixes SF1457569.

  windows will not be lost (tray icon continues to flash)
* Re-implemented  crash  recovery  so that it does  not  have to write to disk
  every minute (uses window  positioning),  removed  setup option as it is for
  free. Better z-order storage so sticky windows are handled better.
* Changed the initial start-up process to copy any installation cfg files into
  the user area so the VW installation can have a 'recommended'  setup but the
  user has access to all cfg files. Fixes SF1178901, SF950115 & SF1210922.

  directory to support roaming profile.

  fixes  SF1017408  &  SF1358979.  Added new  options  'Pop-up  raised  hidden
  windows' & 'Move  popped-up  hidden windows' to control this. Note that some
  apps (like Opera) must be made Tricky windows to work correctly.
* Implemented a Z-order preservation feature, fixes SF1008751 & SF1314574.
* Improved the  reliability  of setting the  foreground  window (this function
  failing is the biggest cause of 'odd' behaviour).

  window appear sticky.

  cannot be retrieved with GetClassLong
* SF1046367, changed setup to allow multiple modifiers.
* Added MSVC v6 make files and build scripts for MINGW & cmd.

  could possibly cause a crash when displaying the window list

  change  desktop,  also added Next and  Previous to the right button  context
  menu.
* Added new 'Move window immediately' option to Desktop State Handling.
* Added support for  "class_name_*" in cfg files (e.g. tricky.cfg)  which will
  match any window with a class name that starts with "class_name_"
* Changed  Access  window menu list to contain all  windows, now this could be
  used as an alternative to Windows Alt+Tab
* Changed the Setup Dialog help to open the right page in the help docs.

  assigned  if the desktop  number is less than zero (i.e. if desk given is -2
  the window is moved to desk 2 and VW changes to desk 2)
* Added  a sdk  interface  to get  VirtuaWin's  installation  & user's  config
  directory.
----------------------------

* Removed the need for registry entry
* SF1205908, periodic check that moved application doesn't reappear in the taskbar
* Updated mousekeys functionality to require a motion tendency towards the edge 
  of the screen to prevent the desktop from swapping unintentionally just 
  because the mouse is near the end of the screen when the meta key is pressed
* Fixed grammar error when recovering windows.  It now properly says 
  "# windows were recovered" or "1 window was recovered"
* Fixed a bug that was causing the right edge or bottom edge of the screen 
  to be detected incorrectly when the secondary monitor was to the left of or 
  above the primary monitor
* Added SF fix 1296291 for alt+tab listing issue
* Added patch 1295748, toggle sticky function was incorrectly implemented.
* Added patch 1295745, this removes some duplicated code which is always nice
* Removed popup alert message when configuring only one desktop
* Made the setup dialog center itself on the primary monitor so that it worked 
  on dual monitor systems.  Prior to this change it was centering itself on the 
  centerline between the two monitors if the secondary monitor was to the left 
  or under the primary monitor, and half way off of the edge of the displays 
  if the secondary monitor was to the right or above the primary monitor.
----------------------------

  have a label. Fixes by Ulf Jaencke-Roessler.
* Fixed so that window coordinates are reloaded when resolution is changed, and also 
  so that taskbar location is reloaded if moved.
* Now we try to locate the MSTaskSwWClass even if it is a direct child of Shell_TrayWnd, 
  this will make it work on more windows version and hopefully get rid of the startup error
  some users have experienced.

  Explorer bug

  also better error message

* Modules will now get a notification when desktop layout has changed since we 
  might have a new current desktop number after a change
* The question mark in the setup dialog is removed since it is no functionality for it
----------------------------

Ver 2.4 2000/08/19
* Bugfix: Added the code again that removes closed windows, this will avoid having closed 
  child windows reappearing again. This fix has the disadvantage of being able to remove 
  valid windows when under heavy load, see next item for more info on a workaround
* Added a module, WinList, in the installation package. This module has a list of all 
  windows on the system and can restore any of them if VirtuaWin should loose them

  Added window title sorting in popup menus (Assign, Direct, Sticky) Added some controls

* Bugfix: Mouse support did not work on win98
----------------------------

Ver 2.2 2000/03/19 
* Added two hotkeys for cycling desktop-number up and down.
* Removed the mousedll. Mouse handling works a little bit different now. This has solved 
  several problems and the only real drawback is that it is not possible to have 0 mouse delay
  anymore, current minimum is 50. Most fixes below come from this mouse change.
* Mouse functionality is totaly disabled when not used. This means that it consumes no CPU time for
  users that disables mouse support.
* Possible to set mouse delay in 50ms precision. 
* Bugfix: Not possible to switch away screensaver locks anymore.
* Bugfix: No unistall problem due to mousedll.dll
* Bugfix: When switching desk with mouse sometimes caused several undesired switches.
* Bugfix: ':' is used as comment character in userlist.cfg instead since some classnames 
  started with '#'.
* Bugfix: Changed display order so that window order should not be moved in the taskbar

  to current desk is pressed.
* Bugfix: No warning message if desktopsize isn't really changed in number of desktops.
* Bugfix: Minor change with hotkey routine, might fix some strange hotkey problems.
----------------------------

Ver 2.1.1 2000/02/23 
* Bugfix: The window menus "access" and "assign" did not show if used alone. This only 
  seemed to happen on NT4, not on win9x and 2000. Fixed by Klaus Gassner.

   if an application is not responding when changing desktop and the application will be ignored.
 * Source code is more organized for easier handling and binary is linked without
   debugging symbols, making it almost half the size
 * Bugfix: Module enable/disable did not work properly with several modules
 * Bugfix: Save sticky on exit did not work if VirtuaWin was shutdown by Windows shutdown/restart.
 * Bugfix: Disabled modules were not saved if VirtuaWin was shutdown by Windows shutdown/restart.
 * Bugfix: Documentation correction regarding MOD_CHANGEDESK w/lParam in Messages.h
 * Bugfix: VirtuaWin tried to switch an invalid window upon every desktop change,
   this fix will probably save a clock cycle or two :)
