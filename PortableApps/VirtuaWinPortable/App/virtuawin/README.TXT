Description
--------------------------------------------------------------
VirtuaWin is a small, fast and easy to use virtual desktop manager for
Windows9x/ME/NT/2000/XP with no unnecessary features. The current desktop is
indicated by a small icon in the system tray to conserve space. There are many
configuration possibilities for both mouse and keyboard control. VirtuaWin
also supports modules for adding features without decreasing the performance
in VirtuaWin itself.
