TeamViewer Portable
===================

CAVEAT: For commercial use, TeamViewer Portable requires a 
        TeamViewer Corporate or Premium license.

This is a complete TeamViewer supporter module that can be directly started
without installation (e.g. from an USB stick). Settings are not saved to
registry.

Please edit the file TeamViewer.ini file and replace the dummy license code in
the 'License' section with your Premium / Enterprise Concurrent license.

By setting LogOutgoingConnections=1 in the TeamViewer.ini file you can force TeamViewer 
to write a log file with detailed information about your connections. 
This log file is used by the TV Manager. 

By setting importsettings=1 you activate the automatic settings import. TeamViewer 
Portable will import the settings from a file called tv.ini which has to be situated 
in the same directory as your TeamViewer.exe. You can create the tv.ini by exporting 
your settings in the advanced options of the full TeamViewer version.
