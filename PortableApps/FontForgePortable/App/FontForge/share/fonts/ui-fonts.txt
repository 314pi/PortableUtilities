Place fonts that you want FontForge to use for its user
interface here. Common fonts to include would be:
* DejaVu Sans/Serif + Sans Mono
* Inconsolata
* WenQuanYi / DroidSansFallbackFull (CJK fonts + a lot more)

=============================================================

NOTE: With Cairo enabled by default, FontConfig is no longer
used for the font backend, and the Windows font subsytem is
used instead. However, fonts can still be loaded for
FontForge to use in the case that such fonts don't
exist on the user's system. 

The specific fonts used must be updated in the FontForge
resource file.
