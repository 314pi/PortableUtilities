&= Button keycode (e.g. &Test = Button can be activated with keyboard shortcut ALT+T / &Dummy = Button can be activated with keyboard shortcut ALT+D ... )

"Dummy - Do not translate" = Means that there is no need for translation, this can be left as it is or it can be safly removed.

Sample for a translation : (German to English)

Note : Do not translate anything before the " = " sign 

Source 			:  FormDirectoryFilter.ButtonCancel.Caption="&Abbrechen"
Translated English	:  FormDirectoryFilter.ButtonCancel.Caption="&Cancel"
Translated Spanish	:  FormDirectoryFilter.ButtonCancel.Caption="&Cancelar"

Just replace the text after the " = " sign.
Note : Sometimes there are missing quotation mark signs, this does not matter, it works with or without.

Every language must be in a seperate file, and must be named as following :

checksumcontrol-XX.nlf

XX is the two-letter code of the language (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)

The file must contain an info block like this :

[Info]
Language="English-Alternate [en]"
Version=2.4
Date=20.05.2013 / V2.0
Autolang="Automatically or English"


Language : The name of the language e.g. : German [XX] (XX is again the two-letter code of the language).
Version :  Program version needed for this file (do not change - must always fit)
Date :	   Any date of translation and the version of the translation - e.g. 20.05.2013 / V1.0 
Autolang : This should contain "Automatically or English" translated into your language. (e.g. "Automatisch oder Englisch" for german)
