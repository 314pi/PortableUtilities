I. Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Pixel Glissade is based, in part, on my first visualizer Pixel Ballet. Taking recommendations from friends, I decided to give a particular polar transform a visualizer of it's own and thus the name Pixel Glissade. For those who care -- Glissade is a gliding or sliding step in ballet.

Pixel Glissade works with the WaveForm and Spectrum data of Sonique to build images that I hope you will enjoy. Pulsing to the music ... color levels changing with the tempo -- these are just a few things I've attempted to add to bring to the listener a nice complement to the music they enjoy.

Feel free to email me at bspangle@visolu.com.

It's boring but please read the Information section below before using Pixel Glissade.

Happy Viewing 
Brian
