Some words from the author:
  I want to thank pulse.interactive for giving me the opportunity to write this visual in their
  precious time, relieving me from other projects during development.

  Greetings out to all,
  SF... (sf@pulse.nl)

  I almost forgot, please contact pulse.interactive and become a client. They will probably
  encourage me to write more nice visuals in the future :)
