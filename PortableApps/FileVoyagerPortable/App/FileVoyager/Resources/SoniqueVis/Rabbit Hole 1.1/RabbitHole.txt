+--                --+

     The Rabbit Hole is an advanced visualization plugin for the Sonique 
media player.  It shows you flying through a tunnel with colorful and 
ever-changing patterns of light and geometry as it spins, flashes, and 
moves to the beat of the music.

     The Rabbit Hole is entirely powered by sound.  The colors, textures, 
shapes, and effects are all determined by different aspects of the music 
that is playing.  It will produce a unique combination of effects for 
every type of music.  Additionally, the beat detection algorithms attempt 
to respond to active spectrum frequencies in order to complement the rhythm 
appropriately.
