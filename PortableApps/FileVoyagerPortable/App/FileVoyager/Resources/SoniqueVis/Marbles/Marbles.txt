Marbles 1.01 - Sonique Visualisation Plugin
	Created by mykel

Contact: mykel@earthling.net

Description/Instructions:
	Sparkling, pulsing marbles with with waveform through the
	centre.  Looks ok with or without any of the additional
	effects.  I tend to use it with blur and smoke at about 75%,
	or full screen 32-bit with no effects.

	This one is quite a processor hog.  Sorry if your machine isn't
	up to the task of making it look ok.

Config:
	The following configuration options for the faited plugin are
	available in the [marbles] section on the vis.ini file.

	StaticColour=0 or 1
		If 1 then the marbles stay blue and red, otherwise
		they cycle through various colours.

	Cloudy=0 or 1
		If 0 then the marbles are completely transparent.
		All you have are the sparkles on the surface and
		the waveform through the centre.  Much faster, but
		loses alot of the feel.

	Sparkles=0 or 1
		If 0 then the surface sparkles are not shown.

	Wavelines=0 or 1
		If 0 then the internal waveform is not shown.
