Xenon and its source code is released under the LGPL with execptions (see license.txt).

Xenon is written in AutoIt.
To compile I recommend using SciTE4AutoIt3.

You must have at least version 3.2.10.
If it does not work properly please upgrade to the latest version.

Both can be downloaded from the AutoIt website: http://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/downloads.php

If you wish to compile Xenon as an executable rather than an a3x set the outfile to Xenon.exe and the outfile_type to exe. Do this ONLY when it will not be run by a launcher. DO NOT do this to Search.a3x, Properties.a3x, AssocationEditor.a3x, etc.
