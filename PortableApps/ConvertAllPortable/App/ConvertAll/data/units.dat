#
# Units are defined by an optional quantity and an equivalent unit or unit
# combination.  A Python expression may be used for the quantity, but is
# restricted to using only the following operators: *, /, +, -.
# Beware of integer division truncation: be sure to use a float for at least
# one of the values.
#
# The unit type must be placed in square brackets before a set of units.  The
# first comment after the equivalent unit will be put in parenthesis after the
# unit name (usually used to give the full name of an abbreviated unit).  The
# next comment will be used in the program list's comment column; later
# comments and full line comments are ignored.
#
# Non-linear units are indicated with an equivalent unit in square brackets,
# followed by either equations or equivalency lists for the definition.  For
# equations, two are given, separated by a ';'.  Both are functions of "x", the
# first going from the unit to the equivalent unit and the second one in
# reverse.  Any valid Python expression returning a float (including the
# functions in the math module) should work.  The equivalency list is a Python
# list of tuples giving points for linear interpolation.
#
# All units must reduce to primitive units, which are indicated by an
# equivalent unit starting with '!'.  A special "unitless" primitve unit
# (usualty called "unit") has '!!' for an equivalent unit.  Circular references
# must also be avoided.
#
# Primitive units:  kg, m, s, K, A, mol, cd, rad, sr, bit, unit
